# menu
## Authors
1. foo
2. bar
## Problem statement for the menu program:
Modify a sample Python program (menu.py) to create a simple restaurant menu using your own original design. 

As you are coding and testing the program, you will send the output to the Python shell. When you are finished with the program, you will send the output to an external file called menu_file.txt. 
## Requirements for the menu program:
1. Open menu.py and run it to see what it does and to be sure it works. The output should appear in your Python shell.
1. In the prolog (as comment statements), put in the following information: the program name, the authors’ names, the date, and any unresolved bugs.
1. Using the sample program as a model, create a menu of your own. Modify the elements that are in the sample program and add new ones.
1. Your program needs to contain the following:
   1. Two text graphics (ASCII art).
   1. One should be a word (like menu), and one should be an object or character. 
   1. Additional information about Joe’s Cafe, such as phone number and address.
   1. Food and/or drink items with their prices.
1. Use at least three string methods in your program.

1. The last thing you need to do is send your program output to a file and add the file to this project.

## Algorithm for your Budget program:
* Write an algorithm for the program below. 
* When you code the program, be sure to include elements of your algorithm as program comments.
